#Role
(General)
* Dominant
? Dominants like to be in charge. Some like to have their partner obey them without questioning, others like some resistance while taking it their way. Some are dominant only in the bedroom, others are dominant throughout their daily life as well. Unlike the top roles (giving pain/bondage/degradation), being dominant is more about who decides what happens (and takes the responsibility that comes with it) than about the contents of what happens.
* Submissive
? Submissives like to follow. Some like to give the control away to their partner(s), some like to have it forcibly taken from them. Some are submissive only in the bedroom, others are submissive throughout their daily life as well (usually with limitations). Unlike the bottom roles (receiving pain/bondage/degradation), being submissive is more about who decides what happens (and takes the responsibility that comes with it) than about the contents of what happens.
* Sadist
? Sadists enjoy inflicting (certain types of) pain on their partner(s), usually in a sexual context.
* Masochist
? Masochists enjoy receiving (certain types of) pain from their partner(s), usually in a sexual context. Masochism is independent of pain tolerance: it is purely about the ability to enjoy (or get aroused by) certain levels of pain.
* Rigger
? Riggers like to tie up and restrain their partner(s), using rope and/or other attributes (chains, cuffs, spreader bars, etc.). Whether for sexual enhancement, for art or just for fun, they enjoy having their partners completely at their mercy.
* Rope bunny
? Rope bunny likes to be tied up and restrained, using rope and/or other attributes (chains, cuffs, spreader bars, etc.). Whether for sexual enhancement, for art or just for fun, they enjoy being totally at the mercy of their partner(s).
* Master/Mistress
? Masters/Mistresses receive complete control over the life of their slave(s), and all responsibilities that come with it. They go a step further than dominants in the sense that their power exchange is present 24/7 and in all aspects of their life (except for negotiated exceptions such as during their office jobs). Their primary focus is to create a stable and safe environment for their slave(s), to allow optimal servitude.
* Slave
? Slaves completely hand over the control and responsibilities over their life to their master/mistress. They go a step further than submissives in the sense that their power exchange is present 24/7 and in all aspects of their life (except for negotiated exceptions such as during their office jobs). Serving their master/mistress is their primary focus in life and they rarely have limits for them.
* Degrader
? Degraders like to degrade and humiliate their play partner(s), either by acting upon them in a degrading way, or by or by forcing them to do things they consider degrading.
* Degradee
? Degradees like to be degraded and humiliated by their play partner(s), either by being acted upon in a degrading way, or by being forced do things they consider degrading.
* Owner
? Owners own pets/properties and take responsibility over them, on a 24/7 basis. Sexuality is not necessarily involved; in some cases role play attributes are also provided (e.g. a cage for the pet). There is no link at all with sex with animals (which is simply not on the BDSM spectrum), and many pets don't even feel like they're playing an animal, it's more about the typical relationship between an owner and a pet.
* Pet
? Pets are property of their owner in daily life. Sexuality is not necessarily involved; in some cases role play attributes are also provided (e.g. a cage for the pet). There is no link at all with sex with animals (which is simply not on the BDSM spectrum), and many pets don't even feel like they're playing an animal, it's more about the typical relationship between an owner and a pet.
* Brat tamer
? Brat tamers are, in essence, dominants who enjoy handling bratty submissives. They find disobedience a form of playfulness from the side of the submissive, rather than a form of rudeness. They will take no offence to it, but will still teach the sub a well deserved lesson (because, of course, that is why the bratty sub shows such behavior in the first place).
* Brat
? Brats are, in essence, naughty submissives. They find disobedience a form of playfulness rather than letting their dominant down, and require a compatible dominant who will not only teach them a lesson, but also accept that any number of lessons might still not necessarily change this behavior.
* Primal (Hunter)
? Primals are mainly focused on their natural instincts and they enjoy letting their inner animal out during sex. The key part for primals play is that the participants show their raw, emotional sexual feelings during play. All of the labels, roles, and protocols go out the window, and the prey can become a snarling, growing, clawing animal hell-bent on getting away from its predator (you).
* Primal (Prey)
? Primals are mainly focused on their natural instincts and they enjoy letting their inner animal out during sex. The key part for primals play is that the participants show their raw, emotional sexual feelings during play. All of the labels, roles, and protocols go out the window, and the prey (you) can become a snarling, growing, clawing animal hell-bent on getting away from its predator.
* Daddy / Mommy
? Daddies/Mommies take on a caretaker role in the relationship, being a guide as much a dominant. Daddies/Mommies dominate their little treasure submissives with an iron fist in a velvet glove: much cuddly and affectionate on the outside, while being as sturdy and hard on the inside as other dominants. Using subtle psychological mechanisms rather than brute power, they nurture their littles into obedience. Sexuality is not necessarily involved, and there is no link at all with pedophilia (which is simply not on the BDSM spectrum).
* Boy / Girl
? Littles (girls/boys) are submissive spirits with a strong flavor childlike innocence. They long for a nurturing loving dominant who plays a guiding, almost parental role in their lives. While they require a softer approach to be dominated than most other submissives, their submission can be just as deep as that of other submissives or slaves. Sexuality is not necessarily involved, and there is no link at all with pedophilia (which is simply not on the BDSM spectrum).
* Ageplayer
? Ageplayers like to play with age as part of their kink. They typically take on a much younger or older age than they actually are, or prefer playing with a partner that does so. Attributes and behavior changes (such as pacifiers, coloring books, speaking in more childlike language, etc.) are commonly paired with this, to enrich the context and make it more appropriate for the played age. Sexuality is not necessarily involved, and there is no link at all with pedophilia (which is simply not on the BDSM spectrum).
* Exhibitionist
? Exhibitionists enjoy showing their naked body or a sexual activity to other people. Consensually, of course.
* Voyeur
? Voyeurs enjoy watching the nakedness or sexual activity of other people. Consensually, of course.
* Experimentalist
? Experimentalists want to have tried it all. An open mind and an insatiable curiosity are their key features, and they will rarely form an opinion before they have gathered first hand experience. They often have plenty of fantasies and will actively pursue to try them out.
* Non-monogamist
? Non-monogamists do not see sexuality as necessarily a 1 on 1 thing. Whether this means they will have several relationships or just see other people outside their relationship (or have even more exquisite constructions) depends entirely on the person and the situation, but they all have one thing in common: their sexuality is more than just between them and one fixed partner.
* Switch
? Switches like to... well, switch. Always taking a dominant or top position is not for them, neither is always taking a submissive or bottom position. Some prefer to switch with the same partner or partners, others have a dominant play partner and a submissive play partner, but in either case they do not fit on one end point of the spectrum.

* Anal Hook
? The purpose of the anal hook is to hold a submissive partner in place during a BDSM scene. While the short end of the hook is inserted into the anus, a rope is threaded through the loop on the long end. That rope can then be attached to an overhead fixture which would hold the wearing in position with their rear in the air or it can be used to bind their wrists.
* Butt Plug
? An anal device with a distinctive, rounded, conical shape that abruptly tapers off before reaching a flat, disc shaped bottom. The anus is gradually stretched until passing over the largest part of the device, after which the device abruptly tapers off to the disc shaped bottom, hence the "butt" is "plugged".

#Bondage
(Self, Partner)
* Blindfolds
* Bondage
* Bondage (multi-day)
* Bondage (public, under clothing)
* Immobilisation
? Immobilization refers to any form of bondage that immobilizes the submissive. This can be through the use of ropes, harnesses and chains, as well as dungeon and other BDSM equipment. In the strictest sense, however, immobilization is seen as an extreme form of bondage where any kind of movement is impossible. It is complete submission to a dominant partner.
* Predicament
? Predicament bondage describes a style of bondage where the bottom has a choice between two or more unpleasant positions or outcomes. 
* Leather restraints
* Chains
* Ropes
* Intricate (Japanese) rope bondage

It is often featured in Japanese fetish pornography and hentai. Natural hemp and jute are the most common types of rope used during Japanese rope bondage.

#Toys & misc. Insertions
(Self, Partner)

? The sound is a long, smooth rod, made from metal or silicone, which can either be straight or curved depending on type. People use sounds to penetrate the urethra both in solo and partnered play.

Both men and women engage in urethral sounding for a variety of reasons. Some enjoy the feeling of penetrating a part of their body that is considered "unusual" or "different." Some enjoy sounding specifically as part of a BDSM dynamic. For men, sounding can access their prostate in ways that no other type play can. 
* Ben Wa balls
? Ben Wa balls are small round balls that are used for strengthening the vaginal wall or for sexual stimulation in women. These balls are generally hollow and contain a small weight inside. Using lubrication, the Ben Wa balls are inserted into a woman's vagina and held there from anywhere from one minute up to an entire day.
* Vacuum Pumps
? A vacuum pump is a sex toy designed to intensify orgasms. When used on men, this device may increase penis size. The pump is also recommended to women who suffer from conditions such as anorgasmia. Vacuum pumps normally create suction around the area to stimulate blood flow and consequently render the penis or vagina more sensitive to external stimulation. Used in both a medical and erotic context, vacuum pumps are readily available on the market.
* Strap-on
* Sybian
? A Sybian is a masturbation aid consisting of a motorized saddle-like seat, usually with a protruding rod, that can be vaginally or anally inserted. It is used to realistically simulate penetrative sex. 
* Fucking machines
? A fucking machine is a mechanical sex toy that simulates penetrative sex. Simple in concept, fucking machines are motorized devices that feature an extended arm to which the user can attach a dildo, vibrator, or butt plug. The motor powers the arm in a repetitive motion, much like intercourse. Different types and models offer different features, such as speed, vibration, intensity and power of pumping motion. Some fucking machines will also allow the attachment of penis sleeves for simulated stroking.

#D/s
(Dominant, Submissive)
* Servitude
? A service D/S relationship involves a submissive performing personal tasks for the dominant partner. In a domestic setting, the submissive can receive satisfaction and pleasure from performing household and service tasks in the role of a butler, maid, waitress, cook, chauffeur, and more.
* Slavery
? A slave is a submissive person who gives up their power to a dominant individual, known as a master or mistress, in a BDSM total power exchange relationship for a defined or undefined time. 
* Brat Play
? A brat will talk back, act out and be obstinate to achieve the goal of being disciplined by their top—and then achieve gratification by eventually acquiescing to their dominant’s desires. 
* Financial Domination
? Financial domination is the power-exchange arrangement a submissive/slave consensually enters into with a financially dominant dom. In most cases, this kind of relationship does not involve sex as other power-exchange relationships do. 
* Discipline
? Discipline refers to the practice of training a submissive to obey a dominant and follow certain rules. It is most common during submissive or slave training, but discipline is also present in all aspects of the relationship between a dominant and submissive. Although punishment can go hand in hand with discipline, it typically focuses more on helping a submissive learn what is expected of them and how to act accordingly. For instance, if a submissive makes an honest mistake, it is the dominant's responsibility to discipline them by showing them the proper way to do something.
* Begging
? Begging is a term for the act of pleading with another person for something. Begging may be a verbal or physical act, or a combination of the two. Begging is usually done by a submissive partner in a BDSM-style relationship, when he or she wants something from the dominant.
* Forced orgasm
? A forced orgasm is a climax experienced by someone who gives up control during sexual play. A submissive person may have a forced orgasm after focused stimulation from a dominant person. As the name of this climax suggests, a forced orgasm occurs even when a person is trying not to come.
* Orgasm control
? Orgasm control is the sexual practice of holding oneself in a state of arousal for an extended period without achieving climax. Due to this elongated final stage of arousal, the sensations of the eventual orgasm may be amplified.
* Orgasm denial
? Orgasm denial is a kind of sex play that involves maintaining a high level of arousal for an extended period of time without experiencing orgasm.
* Orgasm denial (days/month)
* Rules / Routines                
* Power exchange
? These types of relationships involve submissive partners who willingly and voluntarily relinquish control to their dominant partners, either in a specific situation, for a specified period of time, or completely. Once in power exchange relationships, submissive partners must surrender to and obey their dominant partners. Common elements in power exchange relationships include bondage and discipline.
* Position Training
? Position training is the training a submissive in the BDSM community receives to learn a set of desired body positions. During position training, the submissive’s dominant teaches the positions which must be memorized and corrects any errors the submissive makes when executing them.
* Behavior modification
? Behavior modification is a type of consensual domination practice that involves changing undesired behaviors into more desirable ones by using reinforcement or punishment. For example, a Dominant would use behavior modification techniques to encourage a submissive to use proper titles (like Sir or Madam) at all times.
* Eye Contact Restriction
? Eye contact restrictions are a BDSM practice where a submissive is strictly forbidden to look directly in the eyes of a dominant. While they can be physically enforced with blindfolds or masks, typically eye contact restrictions are enforced by forcing the submissive to look down at the floor. Dominants may punish submissives who fail to comply. 
* Speech Restriction / Protocol
? Some dominants insist their partners are totally silent, while others permit forming sounds but not words. Some dominants restrict the speech patterns of their submissives, asking them to use only a limited vocabulary, for example. Speech restriction may be a part of play during a scene or outside it. For example, submissives may never be able to speak at parties or they may need to ask permission before speaking at social gatherings. A dominant may restrict a submissive partner’s speech now and again or whenever certain circumstances arise.
* Forced Exercise
* Forced Masturbation
? Forced masturbation can be a practice that is used in the bedroom or in public. It can be used as a source of public humiliation. The dominant can dictate all means of masturbation including forcing the submissive into performing degrading masturbatory acts.
* Clothing Chosen
* Chastity devices
? A chastity device is a type of garment that can be worn to prevent the wearer from having sexual intercourse or participating in any other sexual activities, including oral sex and manual stimulation. These devices are common in BDSM play and relationships. Submissive partners typically wear these devices as a means to give control of their sexual activities to their dominant partners. To ensure that a submissive does not remove the chastity device, it will usually be secured with a small padlock, to which the dominant holds the key. There are chastity devices for both men and women.
* Food Chosen
* Collar and Leash
* Pushing limits
? Pushing limits is the practice of pushing a submissive past their designated limits during BDSM play. Specifically this term refers to pushing soft limits. These are the limits which may be negotiated with the right partner under the right circumstances. These limits may encompass activities a submissive hasn’t tried, activities the submissive did not enjoy in the past, and activities the submissive has enjoyed but only experienced to a mild degree.

Dominants typically push their submissives’ limits to expand the boundaries of pain allowed in play. This can increase the possibilities for a couple’s play and deepen their connection. Submissives may enjoy pushing their limits to increase their tolerance for pain and experience things they never imagined experiencing before.
                    
#CNC
(Aggressor, Target)
* Rape play
? This type of fantasy and sexual role-play is a common element in BDSM and fetish play. Women and men who have rape fantasies do not want to raped in real life. Many are simply turned on by the thought of someone being so overcome with lust for them that they must take them right then and there. The thought of being completely out of control and under the mercy of a bigger, stronger individual is also a turn-on.
* Blackmail / coercion
? In BDSM, it describes a role-playing game between a top as a blackmailer and a bottom as a victim who is blackmailed for money, actions or objects. This can happen via chat, email, phone or in real life. The victim voluntarily shares private and/or embarrassing information with the blackmailer. In turn, Top uses their publication, use or exposure as a means of pressure.
* Kidnapping / Hostage
? Scene where the submissive will be taken by force to another place, where she/he will be helplessly at the mercy of the kidnapper. Often involves bondage.
* Drugs
* Alcohol
* Sleep play
? Intruding on and touching or fondling a sleeping person. Or getting fondled and touched or penetrated while being asleep.
* Free use
? Free use is a fully-consensual fetish where partners are allowed to sexually “use” each other at any time. This can happen to varying degrees depending on a person’s interests and boundaries.

#Watersports & Scat
(Giving, Receiving)
* Bathroom Control
? Bathroom denial is a sexual practice in BDSM where the dominant partner refuses to let the submissive partner go to the washroom to relieve themselves. It is used as a form of humiliation and control. The submissive must hold in their urges until the dominant partner allows them to get relief under certain terms or after fulfilling certain tasks. Not adhering to the dominant partner's commands can lead to punishment.

Bathroom denial is a very powerful form of asserting control. For the dominant to have control over the submissive's natural bodily functions implies a very strong power.

Because the term can refer to multiple transfers, it calls on the imagery of a snowball, which gets bigger as it is moved along.
* Felching
? Felching predominantly occurs after anal or vaginal intercourse. After the person with the penis ejaculates, that person then performs analingus or cunnilingus to extract the semen from the orifice.

#Humiliation/ degradation 
(Giving, Receving)
* Physical Humiliation
? Physical humiliation is a type of erotic humiliation practiced by some BDSM couples. It involves physical acts which help a dominant partner assert power over their submissive. These may include participation in degrading activities, manipulation of the body, or restrictions over bodily movements.

A range of acts can be considered physical humiliation such as ejaculating, spitting, urinating on a submissive’s body, spanking or whipping the submissive, or depriving the submissive of privacy. A dominant partner may force his submissive to perform acts of servitude, sexually degrading acts, or specific rituals. A submissive may also be required to adhere to a set dress code, such as only wearing lingerie or cross-dressing, or may be asked to wear nothing at all. Animal play may also involve physical humiliation if the dominant partner emphasizes their status over their submissive "pet." Physical humiliation is often used in conjunction with verbal humiliation.
* Public Humiliation
? Public humiliation may involve wearing a particular item of clothing or a fetish item, being unable to speak in social settings, being handcuffed in a prominent public place, being prompted to remove one's underwear, and much more. Public humiliation may be overt or it may occur without spectators konwing such as when a man wears a cock ring in public under his clothes.
* Verbal humiliation
? Verbal humiliation is a type of erotic humiliation typically practiced in BDSM relationships. During verbal humiliation the submissive partner is verbally demeaned by the dominant. 

A dominant partner may use a variety of different terms to verbally humiliate their submissive. During animal play, the dominant partner may refer to the submissive as a pet, bitch, or dog. The word pet may also be used outside of animal play, along with slave, missy, or the child terms, boy or girl. "Boys" or "girls" may also be scolded, as children often are. A more extreme version of verbal humiliation may see the submissive called offensive names such as slut or whore.
* Bodywriting
? Writing demeaning words or orders on the body of a submissive person.
* Eating out of a bowl                
* Spitting
* Washing mouth out with soap
* Objectification (art, furniture...)
* Shaving (body hair)
* Shaving (head hair)
* Slutty clothing (private)

* Public exposure
* Cuckold
? The term describes any man in a committed relationship who enjoys his partner having sex with other people. Cuckolds may have any sexual identity. The partners of cuckolds and the people they have sex with may be of any gender or sexuality. The term cuckold is the masculine equivalent of cuckquean.
* Cuckquean
? A cuckqueen, or female cuckold, is a woman who is aroused by her partner engaging in sexual activity with another partner. The term is normally used to describe a heterosexual or bisexual woman married to a man. However, a cuckqueen may be a lesbian or unmarried in a relationship with someone who sleeps with others.

Cuckqueens receive masochistic pleasure from knowing their partners are intimate with someone else (that third person known as a cuckcake). They may feel jealous or humiliated by their partner, but also turned on by their infidelities. But this should be consensual and not traumatic. The humiliation part is performative or the cuckqueen derives masochistic pleasure from it.

Cuckqueens who are present while their partners have sex with others enjoy watching their partner giving and receiving pleasure. In most cuckqueen relationships, the cuckqueen has a submissive role while their partner is more dominant. Cuckqueens and their partners usually maintain these roles throughout their relationship and during sex, whether another person is present or not.

* Exam Tables
* Medical Appliances

#Sensation Play
(Actor, Subject)
* Abrasion
? Abrasion as a human sexual practice involves sexual arousal from contact with abrasive substances. This can be person-to-person as in a harsh rubbing of the skin known as a dutch rub or with various substances such as scratchy wool or thistles. Use of harsh abrasives such as sandpaper or steel wool will likely cause lasting injury. 
* Scratching
? One person scratching another with their nails, sometimes leaving marks; sometimes but not necessarily painful.
* Biting
? The act of biting or being bitten; sometimes painful, sometimes playful.
* Tickling
? The act of tickling and/or being tickled in a sexual context of a session; or, receiving sexual stimulation from such.
* Kissing
* Violet wand
? A device used for the application of low-current, high-voltage electricity to the body using an Oudin coil, originally claimed to have medical benefits and more recently used in sadomasochistic sex play.
* Tens units
? TENS units use applied current to excite nerves and are usually connected to the skin with two or more electrodes. These electrodes may be the stick-on variety, or may be attached to a sex toy such as a dildo or butt plug. A TENS unit can produce tingling, pain, and at higher frequencies, they may cause involuntary muscular contraction.
* Zapper
? A red stick, sort of like a very low-level cattle prod. It appears to cause about as much pain as those fly zappers that look like tennis rackets.
* Ice cubes
* Wax Play
? The act of using wax, typically hot candle wax, as a form of sexual stimulation and/or torture, or receiving such actions.
* Cupping
? Erotic cupping refers to a form of sensation play in which cups, bowls or bells are used to create suction on the skin. Cupping is an ancient form of alternative medicine that serves to bring blood to the skin and create intense sensations of localized pressure. In BDSM and erotic play, the pressure, in itself, can be an erotic sensation, but drawing blood into the skin also makes that area much more sensitive to other types of stimulation once the cups are removed. There can also be an element of pain involved in cupping, which some people in the BDSM community enjoy as well. Many people love the distinctive bruised marks it leaves, which brand the submissive until they fade. These marks usually fade in a day or two.
* Fire play
? In the BDSM community, fire play is a type of sexual play that involves fire near or directly on a person's skin. This can be done by placing candles or other flames near a person's skin, wiping alcohol on the skin and lighting it, tapping the skin with a lit torch, or flogging a person with a flaming whip or flogger.
* Knife Play
? Knife play is a form of consensual BDSM edgeplay involving knives, daggers, and swords as a source of physical and mental stimulation. Knives are typically used to cut away clothing, scratch the skin, remove wax after wax play, or simply provide sensual stimulation. Knife play can also be a form of temperature play or body modification.

Knife play is sometimes, but not always, a form of fear play. The "victim" in some cases, is shown a sharp implement, and then blindfolded, and a blunt knife used on their skin (for example: the practice of insertive sex play without the certain knowledge of the submissive that an exchange of implements—blunt for sharp—has occurred. This is a form of fear play, yet it still maintains some degree of safety).

For some, knife play can be highly erotic, as the physical and psychological reactions can be intense. It is also an activity that takes a great amount of care to learn properly. As with any sort of edge play that can potentially draw blood, there is the risk of passing diseases along. Also, there is the risk of cutting the wrong spot and causing excessive blood loss, or accidental stabbing. 
* Clamps
? Pressure device applied to nipples or other body parts to create pain which produces pleasure.
* Clothespins
? ? Pinching sking between the forks of a clothes pin
* Sensory deprivation
? Sensory deprivation is a form of sensation play that is often incorporated into BDSM. It involves depriving a person, usually a submissive, of one or more of their senses, such as sight and hearing. This not only helps make them feel more helpless, but it also makes their other senses, like touch, more sensitive to stimuli. This can result in an intensely erotic experience.
* Play Piercing (Needles)
? Play piercing is body piercing that is performed for sexual pleasure rather than aesthetic result. The items used to piece a subject during in play piercing are removed at the end of each session and the wounds are allowed to heal. The needles placed in the skin during a play piercing session are typically just there for that session. These needles are typically placed so that both ends can be accessed, allowing for twisting and pulling on the them to deliver various sensations to the person being pierced. The endorphin high produced by play piercing is quite intense and, in some, can induce orgasm.
* Breast Torture
? Breast torture is achieved with any activity that inflicts some kind of pain of the breasts of the submissive partner. This can include any type of binding with ropes or chains, twisting or piercing of the nipples, pinching with clamps, and/or the use of hot wax. The point of the activity is for the dominant to show authority and to humiliate the submissive, while also simultaneously resulting in pleasure for the submissive and dominant. This practice is often used in conjunction with breast bondage.
* Nipple Torture
? Nipple torture may include use of nipple clamps, clothes pins, binding of the breasts to the chest, breast bondage, caning, flagellation, piercing, or various forms of sensation play including elctricity and temperature. Since the breasts are erogenous zones, the experience in nipple torture is said to be one of pain blended with pleasure.
* Genitorture
? Genitorture is an element of BDSM play which focuses on the pain and pleasure that can come from genital stimulation. Genitorture may involve clamping, slapping or hitting, pinching, abrading, or whipping the genitals. The dominant partner may also pierce the submissive’s genitals, expose them to hot or cold temperatures, or use electrical currents. Genitorture can involve sex toys, household objects like candles and rope, or no external aids at all.
* Anal Torture
? Anal torture is the BDSM practice of inflicting pain or pleasure-pain through anal stimulation. A dominant leads an anal torture scene and stimulates the anus of a submissive person or slave.
* Sploshing
? Sploshing is a term used to describe a sexual fetish that involves smearing the body with wet and messy substances. The most common substances used during sploshing are food items, including whipped cream, chocolate sauce, custard, cake and condiments, just to name a few. Other messy substances, such as mud, can also be used. Individuals aroused by sploshing are sexually aroused by watching someone get messy or by the feeling of these substances being smeared on their own skin. 
* Post-Orgasm Torture
? Post-orgasm torture describes the uncomfortable and sometimes painful stimulation of the genitals immediately following orgasm. For many people, the vulva, clitoris, labia, vagina, penis, anus, scrotum and perineum can be very sensitive immediately after an orgasm. Some people do not want these parts touched in the moments after climax.

Post-orgasm torture may involve stimulation with hands, mouth, feet, penis, vulva, other body parts, sex toys and more. Bondage can be incorporated into the scene to ensure the person being tortured cannot stop their torturer. Note that despite the use of the word torture, the recipient of post-orgasm torture is engaging in a consensual act. It is possible to achieve a very powerful and intense orgasm through this method, but it also involves facing discomfort and ceding control.
* Being brought to tears
? Being brought to tears by spanking or other painful implements.
                    
#Breath Play
(Giving, Receiving)
* Asphyxiation
? Asphyxiation play, also known as breath control play or erotic asphyxiation, is the practice of intentionally restricting the flow of oxygen to the brain for sexual gratification. There are several ways to accomplish the oxygen restriction. They include hanging, using a plastic bag for suffocation, self-strangulation, chest compression, and specific gases or solvents. 
* Choking
? Choking, when used in a BDSM context, is an element of the activity known as breath control. The practice involves restriction of the breath and blood supply to the brain by applying pressure to the blood-rich carotid arteries. Most commonly, choking is done with bare hands, a forearm to the throat, known as a choke hold, or with a prop such as a scarf or length of rope.
* Drowning

#Impact
(Giving, Receiving)
* Spanking
? Spanking, as part of sexual play, occurs when a person slaps a sex partner with an open hand or an object to heighten sexual arousal for one or both parties. Spanking is usually enjoyed by those who find sexual pleasure in pain. It can be done during foreplay or intercourse.
* Flogging
? Floggers typically consist of several tails attached to a rigid handle. The tails may be made from a number of materials, including horsehair, rubber, or leather.

Flogging someone does not have to be something that causes the receiver pain in any way and it isn’t always an extreme sexual activity. In BDSM, the aim isn't to harm but to use pain to increase sensation, and therefore sexual pleasure.
* Single-tail whips
? The term describes the kind of whip that it is. In this instance, there is just one tail on it which differentiates it from multi-tailed whips, like the cat o’ nine tails. They're designed to leave a trail of intense, painful sensation and some marks that come with it. 
* Canes
? A cane is a thin rod used for impact play. The most common are made from rattan, but they are also found in acrylic, lexan, and even stainless steel. Caning can be severe and painful, and it can also be sensual. Some techniques of sensual caning can last an hour or more and even lead to orgasm for some bottoms. 
* Belts
* Riding crops
? A mixture between a cane and a paddle, riding crops are known for their versatility. Also used in equine sports as an encouragement tool, riding crops are long, flexible (usually plastic, in kink) rods with a unique tip at the end.

The tip's flexibility and the material will drastically affect the sensation the crop produces. Riding crops can be used gently or not-so-gently; it's up to you and your partner!
* Hairbrushes
* Paddles
? A paddle is a sex toy with a handle and two flat sides that's usually made of leather or wood. Paddles are often used as part of BDSM or bondage play to give the receiver a light or heavy spank on the bottom. In BDSM, pain is used as a way to enhance sensation and pleasure.
* Breast slapping
* Breast whipping
* Pussy/cock slapping
* Pussy/cock whipping
* Punching
? Hitting or getting hit with a closed fist.
* Hair pulling
* Face slapping
* Leaving Marks
* Bastinado
? Bastinado is a practice in the BDSM community where the soles of one's feet are subjected to whipping and beating, typically using a crop, whip, or cane. In addition, the receiver's feet are tied up and exposed. It is a form of foot fetish which traces its roots to Middle Eastern and far Eastern torture practices.

The sole of one's foot is lined with nerve endings. It is very sensitive to pleasure and pain. So, a light whip can be felt throughout the whole body. When used in BDSM, it is essential to agree on a safe word before proceeding. Bastinado sex play is ideal for submissives who long to feel helpless and completely dominated.
